# HistoricDisks&mdash;Teaser

This repository accompanies the work 
[Hard-disk computer simulations&mdash;a historic perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07715). It provides the 
pressure data of the hard-disk model extracted from the literature since 1953, and also the set of high-precision 
pressures that are presented in the work above. Furthermore, this repository contains naive Markov-chain Monte Carlo 
and molecular dynamics implementations for the hard-disk model, several pressure estimators, as well as a 
state-of-the-art implementations of the hard-disk event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

## Version 0

In its current version 0, this repository serves as a teaser for the complete version 1 that is expected to be finished 
in September 2022. In order to demonstrate the overall style of the programs, this teaser version contains a naive 
sampling program for four hard disks in a non-periodic box that uses the Metropolis algorithm. This repository will
be updated continuously until all programs are online.

## List of programs
The full repository will contain:

- [ ] Pressure data, equations of states
   - [ ] Pressure data files (CSV)
   - [ ] Equations of states visualization (Python)
