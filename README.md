# HistoricDisks&mdash;Preview

This repository accompanies the work 
[Hard-disk computer simulations&mdash;a historic perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07715). It provides the 
pressure data of the hard-disk model extracted from the literature since 1953, and also the set of high-precision 
pressures that are presented in the work above. Furthermore, this repository contains naive Markov-chain Monte Carlo 
and molecular dynamics implementations for the hard-disk model, several pressure estimators, as well as a 
state-of-the-art implementations of the hard-disk event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm.

## Version 0.2

In its current version 0.2, this repository serves as a preview for the complete version 1 that is expected to be 
finished in September 2022. In order to demonstrate the overall style of the programs, this preview version contains 
sampling programs for four hard disks in a non-periodic box that use the Metropolis algorithm, event-driven 
molecular dynamics, or four variants (straight, reflective, forward, and Newtonian) of the event-chain Monte 
Carlo (ECMC) algorithm. The preview version also contains naive sampling programs for an arbitrary number of hard 
disks in a periodic box using all algorithms implemented in the four-disk programs. We also provide a Python script 
that computes the pressure from hard-disk configurations by fitting a polynomial to the estimated pair-correlation 
function and the rescaled line density.

## Installing

All Python scripts can be executed with any Python3 implementation (e.g., standard [CPython](https://www.python.org) or 
[PyPy3](https://www.pypy.org)). The sampling programs do not have any further requirements. Only the script for the 
pressure calculation using the fitting formulas (see [Python/four-disk/fitting.py](Python/four-disk/fitting.py)) relies 
on [NumPy](https://numpy.org) as an external dependency (see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt)). We recommend setting 
up a virtual environment and installing the correct NumPy version by running the following commands (replace `python3` 
by the Python3 interpreter of your choice):

```shell
python3 -m venv historic_venv
source historic_venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -U pip setuptools
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
